My name is BHUAVANESH NAKKA  and  I’m pursing  graduation in MASTERS IN APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE in the reputed university named NORTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY[NWMSU] and I will be  graduating  by December 2020.

I’m from INDIA. I completed my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from R.M.D ENGINEERING COLLEGE ,Chennai  in the year 2018. I’m personally greatly interested in courses like DATABASE SYSTEMS, MOBILE DEVELOPMENT and CODING LANGUAGES (java, c, c#) so in order gain much more knowledge in these courses, I decided to pursue masters. My hobbies are listening to music, coin collection and reading books.
